## Welcome to the Civpick-UI-Project
Created to enjoy an unique look of [civilization drafts](aoe2cm.net) on [Nili's](https://twitch.tv/nili_aoe) streams.

Drawings were made and owned by [AgniousPrime](https://twitch.tv/agniousprime).
Code was written by SyntacticSalt (or SyntacticSugar, who knows).
